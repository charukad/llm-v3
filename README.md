# Mathematical Multimodal LLM System

A sophisticated mathematical assistant system that combines the natural language capabilities of large language models with specialized mathematical processing, handwriting recognition, and visualization tools.

## Project Overview

This system aims to provide advanced mathematical capabilities through multiple modalities:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process mathematical queries expressed in natural language
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: Perform operations across various mathematical domains
- **Symbolic Mathematics**: Execute precise symbolic computation
- **Handwriting Recognition**: Process images of handwritten mathematical notation
- **Visualization Generation**: Create appropriate visualizations of mathematical concepts
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Generate detailed solution paths with clear reasoning

## Project Structure

The project is organized around an agent-based architecture:

- `core/`: Core LLM Agent (Mistral 7B)
- `math_processing/`: Mathematical Processing Agent
- `multimodal/`: Multimodal Input Agent
- `visualization/`: Visualization Agent 
- `search/`: Search Agent
- `orchestration/`: Communication and workflow orchestration
- `database/`: Data persistence components
- `api/`: API endpoints
- `web/`: Web interface
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts
- `docs/`: Documentation
- `deployments/`: Deployment configurations
- `integration_tests/`: Integration tests
