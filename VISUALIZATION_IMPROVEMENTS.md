# Natural Language Visualization Improvements

## Overview of Changes

We've improved the natural language visualization detection system to address several key issues:

1. Fixed 3D surface plot detection by prioritizing it over 2D function detection
2. Enhanced pattern matching for contour plots and complex functions 
3. Improved mathematical expression parsing and validation
4. Added better error handling and debugging capabilities
5. Enhanced visualization type classification
6. Added dependency checking for required libraries

## Specific Improvements

### 1. 3D Surface Plot Detection

Previously, 3D surface plots were being incorrectly classified as 2D function plots. We've fixed this by:

- Prioritizing 3D surface detection by checking for it first in the pattern matching order
- Adding more comprehensive pattern matching for 3D surface expressions
- Improving detection for variations like `f(x,y) = ...`, `z = ...`, and implicit 3D expressions
- Better handling of mathematical notation (e.g., handling both `^` and `**` for exponents)
- Adding specific handling for saddle functions, peak functions, and wave surfaces

### 2. Complex Function Detection

We've enhanced complex function detection with:

- More comprehensive pattern matching for complex function expressions
- Support for domain coloring, phase plot, and complex plane terminology
- Better handling of common complex functions like `z^2`, `1/z`, `e^z`, etc.
- Proper classification of absolute value, real part, and imaginary part visualizations

### 3. Contour Plot Detection

Contour plot detection has been improved with:

- Enhanced pattern matching for level curves, equipotential lines, etc.
- Better disambiguation between contour plots and 3D surfaces
- Support for filled contours and colormap specifications
- Improved extraction of contour-specific parameters like number of levels

### 4. Expression Parsing Improvements

We've significantly improved mathematical expression parsing:

- Added better handling of power notation (both `^` and `**`)
- Fixed extraction of expressions with surrounding text
- Added support for mathematical constants like Ï€ (pi)
- Improved range extraction with support for intervals, fractions, and special values
- Fixed cleanup of expression prefixes (e.g., removing `z =`, `f(x,y) =`, etc.)

### 5. Error Handling and Debugging

We've added robust error handling and debugging:

- Created a comprehensive debug endpoint for visualization detection
- Added detailed logging throughout the detection process
- Improved error messages with context-specific suggestions
- Added validation and fixing of extracted parameters
- Added retry mechanism for misclassified visualization types

### 6. Dependency Management

We've enhanced dependency checking:

- Added explicit dependency checking for required libraries
- Added detailed logging of missing dependencies
- Set flags to track dependency status for better error reporting

## Testing Framework

We've created testing tools to validate our improvements:

1. A debug visualization detection script to test specific cases
2. A comprehensive test suite covering all visualization types
3. A focused test for edge cases and previously problematic scenarios

These improvements should significantly enhance the reliability of the natural language visualization system, particularly for 3D surface plots, contour plots, and complex function visualizations.
